Features:
 - Can create simple production, with configurable components and resulting products, without having to create a list of materials
 - Creates two stock pickings, with configurable picking type. The pickings can be accessed from the simple production screen, and can be validated automatically or manually
 - The stock price for the resulting product(s) is computed from the stock price of the components. If multiple products are in the result, the price must be entered manually
 - A new product and a new sale order can be created automatically for the resulting product (the user must be in the "	Sale simple production" group). The sale price of the resulting product is computed from the sale price of the components
