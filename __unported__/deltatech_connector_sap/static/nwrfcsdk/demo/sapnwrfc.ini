DEFAULT
# Trace all connections/destinations, which do not explicitly define
# their own trace level, with level 1. If this value is not set, the
# default is 0. Possible values are 0(off), 1(brief), 2(verbose), 3(full)
# RFC_TRACE=2

# The following four parameters are evaluated only once at process
# startup, not when reloading the sapnwrfc.ini file at a later point.

# By default, all trace files are written into the current working
# directory of the process. If you want to change that location, use
# RFC_TRACE_DIR=/absolute/path/to/tracedir

# By default, the NW RFC library creates one trace file per thread, in
# order to avoid multiple threads interleaving their trace output.
# If you want one trace file for the entire process, specify
# RFC_TRACE_TYPE=PROCESS

# When tracing data that contains non-ISO-8859-1 characters, the trace
# file becomes corrupted. In that case use the following parameter to
# change the file encoding of the trace file. Possible values are
# UTF-16 and UTF-8. If the parameter is not specified, the default platform
# encoding is used, which is CP1252 or ISO-8859-1 on most Windows systems,
# and UTF-8 on most Linux systems.
# On Windows UTF-16 shows better performance than UTF-8, because no additional
# conversion is required. On Linux, UTF-8 is recommended.
# RFC_TRACE_ENCODING=UTF-16

# In SM59, there is the option to "export" the trace level from ABAP side to
# an external RFC server program. If that flag is activated, the RFC library
# starts tracing incoming RFC calls with an RFC trace level of 2. In some cases
# it may be useful to refuse to accept the exported trace level from backend
# side, e.g when you want to prevent that an ABAP user can flood the discspace
# of the external server, or when payload data should not be written into
# trace files. In this case you can set the parameter
# RFC_ACCEPT_EXPORTED_TRACE=0
# and the RFC library will not write traces, even if the backend requests it.
# Possible values: 0 (for false) and 1 (for true).

# By default, the NW RFC library keeps two "rolling" trace files of maximum
# size 512 MB (in older versions: 64 MB). If during trouble-shooting this turns
# out to be not sufficient to capture the problematic situation in the trace,
# e.g. because it appears only at random after a non-deterministic runtime of
# the program, you can increase this file size by setting the parameter
# RFC_TRACE_MAX_FILE_SIZE=1024M
# As unit of measure you can use "M" for Megabytes or "G" for Gigabytes.

# Sometimes a developer of an RFC program uses the function RfcSetTraceLevel()
# with a trace level of 0 at the beginning of the program. In that case there is
# no way of ever activating RFC trace and trouble-shooting the program without
# re-compiling it. (Which may be particularly inconvenient, if it is a program
# obtained from a third party and source code is not available for it...)
# In that case you can set the parameter
# RFC_MINIMUM_TRACE_LEVEL=2
# and then the function RfcSetTraceLevel() can never set the trace level to a lower
# value than the one defined here.

# The global CPIC trace level used by the underlying CPIC libabry to write
# CPIC tracing information to the CPIC trace file cpic_<pid>.trc, where pid 
# is the process ID of the current process. The CPIC trace file
# is located in the same directory where the RFC trace files are located.
# A integer value between 0 to 3 can be set. The default is the value specified
# by the environment variable CPIC_TRACE if this environment variable is defined,
# otherwise the default is 0.  
# CPIC_TRACE=3

# Activating the CPIC keepalive per CPIC_KEEPALIVE (SAP note 2606606)
# Must be a value between 10 and 3600, where 0 turns the cpic keepalive off.
# CPIC_KEEPALIVE=60

# 1. General Connection parameters
# These can be used with client and server programs

# SAPROUTER       : If the connection needs to be made through a firewall
			via a SAPRouter, specify the SAPRouter parameters in the
			following format:
			/H/hostname/S/portnumber/H/
# SNC_LIB         : Full path and name of third-party security library to
			use for SNC communication (authentivation, encryption and signatures)
			Alternatively you can set the environment variable SNC_LIB.
# SNC_MYNAME      : Token/identifier representing the external RFC program
# SNC_PARTNERNAME : Token/identifier representing the backend system
# SNC_QOP         : One of the following values:
			1 Digital signature
			2 Digital signature and encryption
			3 Digital signature, encryption and user authentication
			8 Default value defined by back-end system
			9 Maximum value that the current security product supports
# TRACE           : One of 0(off), 1(brief), 2(verbose), 3(full)
# PCS             : "Partner character size". In 99.9% of the cases you
			don't need to bother with that. During the initial handshake
			the RFC library obtains the correct value from the backend and
			uses it from then on. One rare usecase is as follows: you know
			that the backend is Unicode and want to use a non-ISO-Latin-1
			username or password for the initial logon. As the initial handshake
			is done with ISO-Latin-1, the characters in username/passwd would
			break, resulting in a refused logon. In that case set PCS=2 and the
			RFC library will use Unicode for the initial handshake.
# CODEPAGE        : Similar to PCS above. You only need it if you want to connect
			to a non-Unicode backend using a non-ISO-Latin-1 username or password.
			The RFC library will then use that codepage for the initial handshake,
			thus preserving the characters in username/password.
			A few common values are:
			1401: ISO-Latin-2
			1500: ISO-Latin-5/Cyrillic
			1600: ISO-Latin-3
			1610: ISO-Latin-9/Turkish
			1700: ISO-Latin-7/Greek
			1800: ISO-Latin-8/Hebrew
			1900: ISO-Latin-4/Lithuanian/Latvian
			8000: Japanese
			8300: Traditional Chinese
			8400: Simplified Chinese
			8500: Korean
			8600: Thai
			8700: ISO-Latin-6/Arabic
			However, please note that these values can be customized in the backend.
			Better consult the backend sysadmin first, as otherwise things may go
			terribly wrong...
# NO_COMPRESSION  : By default the RFC protocol compresses tables, when they reach a
			size of 8KB or more. On very rare occasions you may want to turn this
			off, for example if you are transporting huge integer/binary tables with
			"random" data, where compression would have no effect except for burning CPU...
# ON_CCE          : "On Character Conversion Error". What shall the NW RFC lib do, when it encounters
			a character that does not exist in the target codepage, a broken character
			or a control character (0x00 - 0x19)? This parameter can
			take three values:
			0: Abort with an error message (default behaviour). Note that in this case
			   control characters (e.g. tabulator, carriage return or linefeed characters)
			   are not considered "illegal" and will therefore not cause an abort.
			1: Copy the character in a "round-trip compatible way". The resulting output
			   character may be "garbage" in the target codepage, but when converted back
			   to the source codepage, it will be the original character.
			2: Replace the character with a substitute symbol (usually a # character).
			   Note that in this case the control characters are replaced as well. If you need
			   the control characters, then you'll have to use option 0 or 1, depending on whether
			   you want the NW RFC Lib to abort the call in case of broken characters or not.
# CFIT            : "Conversion Fault Indicator Token". The substitute symbol used if ON_CCE=2.
			Needs to be given as hexadecimal value of a Unicode codepoint.
			The default is 0x0023 ("# character").
# KEEPALIVE       : Sets the keepalive option. Default is 0.
                        Possible values are:
                        0: keepalive option is not set
                        1: set SO_KEEPALIVE option for the tcp socket of the connection
                           behaviour can be controlled by OS tcp keepalive parameters



# 2. Parameters used in client programs

# USER      : Username
# PASSWD    : Password
# CLIENT    : The Client or "Mandant" to which to logon.
# LANG      : Logon Language. Either specify the two-character ISO-Code (like EN for English,
			KO for Korean) or the one-character SAP-specific code (like E for English,
			3 for Korean). Note that the ISO-codes are case-insensitiv, while the SAP
			codes are not! So 'D' logs you on in German, while 'd' logs you on in
			Serbian, if that language is installed in your system...

# PASSWORD_CHANGE_ENFORCED: Specify whether a user must change his password during logon when the backend system challenges 
				this user to do so because a) the password is initial; b) the password has expired; c) or a changed password
				policy enforces the change of the password. Possible values are:
				0: Do not enforce the change (default). If no PasswordChangeHandler is installed, the NW RFC Lib will use the
				   initial/expired password to login.
				1: Enforce the password change. In this case, the application has to call RfcInstallPasswordChangeHandler()
				   to install a callback function, which will be called by the NW RFC Library during a call to
				   RfcOpenConnection(). If no PasswordChangeHandler is installed or the callback function
				   returns a value other than RFC_OK, the call to RfcOpenConnection will fail with RFC_LOGON_FAILURE.
				Whether or not the NW RFC Library is able to change the password and login at all, also depends on the
				value of the backend profile parameter rfc/reject_expired_passwd. See SAP note 161146 for details.
				If the backend system rejects expired/initial passwords (the above profile parameter is set to "1"), then there
				is nothing you can do about this: you need to change the user's password via SAPGui.
# SNC_SSO   : Specify whether to use SNC single sign-on or not if SNC is enabled. Possible values are:
			0:  don't use SNC single sign-on
			1:  use SNC single sign-on (default)
# MYSAPSSO2 : Use this parameter instead of USER&PASSWD to log on with an SSO2 ticket (Single-Sign_On)
			or with an "Assertion" ticket (starting with backend release 7.00).
# GETSSO2   : Set this to 1, if the backend should generate an SSO2 ticket for your user.
			If RfcOpenConnection() succeeds, you can retrieve the ticket with
			RfcGetPartnerSSOTicket() and use it for further logons to systems supporting
			the same user base.
		!!! Note: No longer supported! SAP systems shall no longer issue tickets during user logon!!!
# X509CERT  : Use this parameter instead of USER&PASSWD, if you want to logon with an X.509
			certificate. The certificate needs to be Base64 encoded and needs to be
			mapped to a valid user in the backend's user configuration.
# EXTIDDATA : Old logon mechanism similar to SSO. No longer recommended.
# EXTIDTYPE : See EXTIDDATA.
# LCHECK    : If you set this to 0, RfcOpenConnection() only opens a network connection but
			does not perform the logon procedure. I.e. no user session will be created
			inside the backend system. Note that such a connection is not particularly
			useful: the only function module you can execute over it is RFC_PING...
# USE_SAPGUI: Specifies whether a SAPGui should be attached to the connection. Some (old) BAPIs
			need this, because they try to send screen output to the client while
			executing. Possible values are:
			0: no SAPGui (default)
			1: attach a visible SAPGui.
			2: attach a "hidden" SAPGui, which just receives and ignores the screen output.
			Note that for values other than 0: a SAPGui needs to be installed on the
			machine, where the client program is running. This can be either a normal
			Windows SAPGui or a Java Gui on Linux/Unix systems.
			Note on USE_SAPGUI=2: this type has a negative performance impact. If you
			are using only one function module that needs a Gui, and a large number of
			"normal" function modules, you should consider the following alternatives:
			a) Open the connection with USE_SAPGUI=1, and immediately after each RFC call
			   that may invoke SAPGui, make an RFC call to the FM SYSTEM_INVISIBLE_GUI on
			   the same connection to hide the SAPGui. Call your other FMs as usual.  
			b) Open two connections, one without USE_SAPGUI parameter and one with USE_SAPGUI=2.
			   Use the first connection for executing all "normal" FMs and the second connection
			   whenever you need to call the FM that uses the Gui.
# ABAP_DEBUG: Can be used for R/3 systems with release < 6.20, where "external breakpoints" are not
			yet available. The connection is opened in debug mode and the invoked function
			module can be steped through in the debugger. Possible values:
			0: no debugging (default)
			1: attach a visible SAPGui and break at the first ABAP statement of the
			invoked function module.
			Note that for debugging a SAPGui needs to be installed on the machine,
			where the client program is running. This can be either a normal Windows
			SAPGui or a Java Gui on Linux/Unix systems.
			For backend releases >= 6.20 use "external breakpoints" instead (see note
			668256), as this is more convenient and allows the debugger to run on any
			host, not only the host on which the RFC client program is running.

# DELTA:   : Specify whether to use delta-manager when serializing / deserializing table parameters passed by using TABLES clause.
			Possible values are:
			0:  don't use delta-manager
			1:  use delta-manager (default)
 
# USE_REPOSITORY_ROUNDTRIP_OPTIMIZATION: The standard mechanism for reading function module descriptions from the backend's
			DDIC requires one DDID lookup for every structure/table that the function module in question possesses. As this may
			result in lots and lots of roundtrips to the backend, if the function module or BAPI has hundreds of structures and
			table parameters, a new mechanism was implemented in the DDIC, which allows to read the metadata of a function module
			in one go. You can even load several function modules (and their structures and tables) into the NW RFC library's
			DDIC cache at once, using the function RfcMetadataBatchQuery(), for example at initialization time of your application.
			See also the documentation of that function.
			If you want to use this improved DDIC lookup mechanism, first make sure that your backend system has at least the
			support package level described in SAP note 1456826, and then set this logon parameter to "1". All DDIC lookups over
			this client connection will then use the new mechanism.


# In addition you need parameters from one of the following two groups:


# 2.1 Parameters for direct application server logon

# ASHOST  : Hostname of the application server.
# SYSNR   : The backend's system number. (E.g. "01")


# 2.2 Parameters for load balancing

# MSHOST          : Hostname of the message server, which is doing the loadbalancing.
# MSSERV          : Not needed in most cases. Specify this parameter only, if the
			message server does not listen on the standard service "sapms<SysID>",
			or if this service is not defined in the services file and you need to
			specify the network port directly. Note: on Unix the services are
			defined in /etc/services, while on Windows they are defined in
			C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\services.
# R3NAME or SYSID : The backend's system ID. (E.g. "H9C"). If this parameter is not
			specified, the value of DEST is used instead.
# GROUP           : The logon group from which the application server should be chosen.
			If this parameter is not specified, "PUBLIC" is used.
# USE_SYMBOLIC_NAMES : Defines, whether during group-logon the NW RFC library should use symbolic service names
			defined in /etc/services, like sapgw33, or hard-coded port numbers derived from the
			instance number, like 3300.
			Values:
			0: use port numbers (default)
			1: use service names



# 3. Parameters used in server programs

# GWHOST               : Hostname of the RFC gateway at which to register. Usually some
				application server host.
# GWSERV               : Either specify "sapgw<SysNr>" or the port number directly, if
				that service is not defined in the services file. (Also see MSSERV.)
# TPNAME or PROGRAM_ID : The program ID used to identify the SM59 RFC destination, for which
				we want to receive requests.
