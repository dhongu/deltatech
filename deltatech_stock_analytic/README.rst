Features:
 - An analytic account can be assign to a stock location
 - At stock move confirmation, if both source and destination locations have analytics accounts set, two analytics line are created: one with plus (+) sign on the source location analytic and one with minus (-) sign on the destination location analytic.
 - The values for the analytic lines are computed from the stoc move price unit or, if not present, from the product cost price
