This module:
 - adds the field "code" in the Time Off Type form
 - in the employee menu in list view you can select employees then press "Action" -> "Export Working Days" to
   make an Excel file that contains the employees with their hours worked per day number of hours worked in total
   , the number of meal vouchers earn by the employee and see the days they were on time off
 - if the code field in Time Off Type form is empty the cell will have "ABS" instead of the type of time off code
