## 19.0.3.3.1 (2026-09-25)

- Fix: the "Expenses Deductions" smart button on the employee form had no
  group restriction, so any internal user without an expenses group got an
  access error on `deltatech.expenses.deduction` when opening an employee
  (e.g. a Time Off officer). The button is now shown only to the expenses
  groups (Employee, Approver, Accounting).
