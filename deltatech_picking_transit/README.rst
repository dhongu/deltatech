Features:
 - On the stock picking type form you can add "next operation"
 - when you make an internal transfer with a picking type that has the "next operation" set, the system gives you the option to make the transfer a 2 step one with the button "create transfer"
 - the button will create another transfer from the transit location to the location selected on the wizard with the same move lines
 - after the second transfer is created, you will not be able to modify the move lines of the initial transfer
